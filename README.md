# machineLearning2
This repository contains the work of our team for the project 2 of the machine learning class at EPFL. It is divided in multiple notebooks detailing the different methods we used to reach our goals. 

## The best model
The notebook that is interesting for grading as it received our maximal accuracy on the AICrowd dataset is [tfidf_ridge.ipynb](tfidf_ridge.ipynb)

## Citations of other works and libraries
Libraries required for these notebooks to all run are detailed in the notebooks. Most of them are readily available on any Python installation. We also occasionally used small code snippets that were open to use from the Internet, and those cases are cited when used. We used such sources twice : in tfidf-related notebooks for preprocessing, and in BERT for vectorizing the tweets.

## Data location
Data files should be placed in the data/ folder. Location is clear from the notebook use.
